<p><strong>Summer Camp 2k16</strong> was conducted on <strong>22nd June to 24th June, 2016</strong> at <strong>University College of Engineering, Villupuram</strong>. We (<strong>Me</strong>, <a href="https://ragulkanth.github.io"><strong>Ragul Kanth</strong></a>, <a href="https://manimaran96.wordpress.com/"><strong>Manimaran</strong></a>) have organized the event. This is one of the mega event conducted at Villupuram powered by <a href="https://fsftn.org"><strong>FSFTN</strong></a> through <strong>GNU/Linux Users Group - Villupuram</strong> and <strong>GNU/Linux Users Group - UCEV</strong>. This is an Three day Workshop on various Free Software technologies such as Blender, GNU/Linux, Bootstrap, Python etc. </p>
<h2><strong>A step forwared for Summer Camp 2k16</strong></h2>
<p>The Work was started before a month from the event. The first planning was made on June 5, 2016 with few activist of FSFTN. Later it was followed and works started blooming. We have decided to conduct the event at July 22, 23 and 24, 2016. The Activist from University College of Engineering, Villupuram and IFET College of Engineering was paid their whole interest. </p>
<h2>Registration plan</h2>
<p>We have planned to collect Rs 600 each for providing them pendrive, food, snacks, cheat sheets and certificate. For registration we have selected an ambassadors from various colleges. Students from those colleges could register through respective ambassadors. We also had a public venue for other peoples at <strong>Vel Tech Computers</strong>, Villupuram. </p>
<h2>Work Efforts</h2>
<p>Venue confirmation work gets started first. We have approached <strong>Dr. Senthil, Dean, UCEV</strong> for getting venue at UCEV. Successfully we got permission for conducting the camp in our college with food and accommodation for volunteers. 
And then <strong>Designing work was started</strong>. We have started designing the web page immediately after confirming the venue. We also created the poster and distributed to various colleges in Villupuram. Volunteers also designed small mimes and shared in the social medias for promoting the event.
Once all those works got completed, we went to many colleges in Villupuram such as <strong>Mailam Engineering College, AR College of Engineering, VRS College of Engineering and Technology, University College of Engineering, Panruti, University College of Engineering, Tindivanam, Surya College of Engineering</strong>, etc. and approached the HOD of CSE and ECE dept. and explain about  FSFTN and Summer Camp. They allowed us to meet their students and explain about the workshop. We went to the class rooms and explained about the Technical topics we have enveloped in this camp. Really we got good response from them.</p>
<h2>Registration</h2>
<p>Registration was started on <strong>11th of July</strong>. We have started to inform the colleges around Villupuram and we have selected one among them as a ambassador (Also gave importance for the people who have already attend the GLUG meetups and had a prior knowledge about our activities). We have fixed 18th July as a last date but later we have extended upto 20th July. The ambassadors are provided with a registration book  which need to be filled with the participant details who are registering for the Summer Camp. We have provided one book per college with 30 tickets (slip in the book) but we are made to give additional books as more than 30 peoples was eagerly registered (Some colleges). Finally we have collected the amount and registration book from the ambassadors and created the overall list of the participants. <strong>Total registration was 156</strong>.</p>
<h2>Action Plan</h2>
<p>We have plan to separate the participants into various groups. Each group contains 8 members from various colleges, various departments and various year with equal count of boys and girls. Each groups is leaded by our volunteers. There are about 29 groups. The volunteers had prior knowledge about the technologies that was taken in various sessions. So that, participants can ask their doubts to their volunteer who will be as one among them. It was really a successful attempt. This also helps the speakers as well as the participants. We made fully hands on sessions, participants are adviced to bring laptops. <a href="https://ragulkanth.github.io"><strong>Ragul Kanth</strong></a> <strong>customized the GNU/Linux Operating System</strong> with the nessesary packages such as Blender, Flask, etc. <strong>Mr. Balaji</strong> took responsible for the speakers.</p>

<ol>
<li>git init =&gt; initiate the git in particular folder. That is, once this command was executed, the current working folder will tracked by the git.</li>
<li>git clone =&gt; This command will be executed along with the url. This command is used to clone (Make a copy) the project or file form the specific url.</li>
<li>git add =&gt; This command will be executed along with file name. This will add the changes (creation, edition, deletion, modification of a file) made in that folder to the git.</li>
<li>git commit =&gt; This will be executed alog with <em>-m "Message"</em>. This will save the changes that added to the git using the previous command and in message, the changes what we have made will be specified, so that others can understand the current status of that project.</li>
<li>git push =&gt; This command will push the edited or modified or updated project to the central repo.</li>

</ol>

On this session he explained about <strong>Arduino</strong> (A prototyping hardware). Arduino is an open hardware. In the sense that, Its Schemas are available openly and hence it is called as Open Hardware. There are also other few open hardwares available such as <em>Beagle Bone BLack</em>, etc. He concluded with the <strong>IOT</strong> and the <strong>Community Weather Station</strong> they have installed in <strong>Pondicherry</strong>. </p>
