<p>Summer Camp 2015, was a mega event conducted by Free Software Foundation Tamil Nadu. That was an six day workshop and industrial training program conducted at <strong>IIT-Madras</strong> on <strong>Jun 8 – Jun 13, 2015</strong>. There were about 120+ participants. I have <strong>Volunteered</strong> that camp. I was provided with a team of 6 members I need to be with them and guid them through out the workshop and I have to clarify their doubts where ever they struck. There are various technical sessions were taken on that camp as follows</p>
<p>Each day contains various sessions with various technologies such as <strong>GNU/Linux, Ruby and Ruby on rais, NodeJS, Meteor, GIT, Blender etc.</strong> There I have found out myself as <strong>Quick Learner</strong> coz some technologies were new to me and so I need to listern asap my team members do. Because if they got doubt, I have to clarify them. Ofcours volunteers like me arround us and they were ready to help me. From that Summer Camp, I am one of the fans of BLENDER. Blender is an awesome 3d animation suit, simple and effective. It actually made us to sit at the corner of the seat while rendering. I got really an cooperative team members. Though some problem among them were arises, I have helped them to solved it and they have cooperated for my words. We have named our team <em>Code Hunters</em>. True to the name everyone were well knowledged and they were mutually helpful. </p>
<p>We also had some non technical sessions such as Tamil Computing etc. for referance, <a href="http://fsftnsummercamp.org/">SC2k15</a>.</p>
